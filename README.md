## Our final 3 ideas are:

* HabitSync: HabitSync is a personal development web app designed to help you build and maintain habits through the power of gamification and accountability groups. Gamification keeps you motivated with badges, and progress tracking, making habit-building fun and engaging. Meanwhile, accountability groups foster a supportive community, ensuring you stay committed and consistent as a team. With HabitSync, achieving your goals becomes a shared and rewarding journey!

* ClassBuddy: ClassBuddy is a web application designed to enhance collaborative learning for students by helping them form study groups, share resources, and organize projects. The platform enables students to connect with peers based on shared academic goals, class enrollment, and interests, making group study and collaboration easier and more efficient. It integrates tools for file sharing, scheduling, and real-time collaboration to ensure a streamlined group learning experience. By offering features like AI-generated study aids, gamified rewards, and calendar synchronization, the app encourages productivity and fosters academic success.
  
* NYU Apartment Search: NYU Apartment Search is a mobile and web application designed to simplify the apartment search process for NYU students. The platform connects students looking for apartments to rent, sublease, or share, as well as those seeking compatible roommates. By centralizing apartment and roommate listings and integrating advanced filtering options, the app eliminates the chaos of relying on external messaging platforms like WhatsApp and ensures an efficient, student-focused search experience.
